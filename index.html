                            The purpose for VPN is to establish a secure connection with Penn State from <strong>off</strong> campus using the "<strong>ISPtoPSU</strong>" connection.  This would be used to connect to Penn State network-restricted resources (such as PASS and BOX) from off campus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want access to your Education file share off campus you will need to connect to VPN, also if you are prompted to update your Education password while you’re off campus you will want to connect to VPN before changing your College of Education (ED) password.

                                    This is an ongoing Penn State security initiative that will help to protect the user, the College, and the University, from Personally Identifiable Information (PII) breaches.

                                    Scans will take place every 30 days and you will be required to take action when prompted, by Identity Finder (IDF), if anything is found during the scan.

                                  <dd>Permanently delete locations containing sensitive information, so thieves and viruses do not find any information that would cause a data breach.</dd>

                                    Sometime in November, December 2016 or January 2017 the IDF console will change along with the look a feel of the software our clients use to remediate PII on their systems.

                                    For example, we know our ongoing efforts have already resulted in eliminating PII which, if inappropriately disclosed, could have cost the University nearly $500K so an upgrade is required. We believe this represents just a small fraction of the PII that remains in various locations across campus.

                                    Current security policies, scheduled scans, and requirements, to take action, will continue. Users are responsible for remediating any PII data.
